# Chat Interface using OpenAI API

This project aims to create a chat interface using the OpenAI API, allowing users to interact with GPT-4 for text completion, function calling, code interpretation, retrieval, and DALL-E for image generation.

## Goals

- Create a user-friendly chat interface that mimics the ChatGPT interface.
- Integrate the OpenAI API to enable text completion using GPT-4.
- Implement function calling, code interpretation, and retrieval features.
- Include DALL-E integration for image generation.
- Support multiple conversations with the ability to archive, delete, or export conversations.

## Technologies Used

- Python Flask for the backend server.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface.
- OpenAI API for text completion, function calling, code interpretation, retrieval, and DALL-E.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Set up your OpenAI API key.
4. Run the Flask server.
5. Access the chat interface in your web browser.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more advanced interactions, such as voice commands.
- Improve the user interface to make it more interactive and intuitive.
- Optimize the application for performance and scalability.
